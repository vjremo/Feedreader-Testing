Feed Reader Testing by Vijay for Udacity's Frontend-nanodegree
==============================================================

# Overview

This project tests an web-based application that reads RSS feeds using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) 


# What all do we test?

According to [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric), below tests are conducted on the web-application

1. Iterate through all feeds and verify that each feed is named
2. Iterate through all feeds and verify that each feed has URL defined
3. Check if the menu element is collapsed by default and can be opened/closed upon click
4. When feed is completely loaded, verify that it has atleast one feed
5. When a new feed is fetched upon loading, check if the contents loaded differ from previous feed
